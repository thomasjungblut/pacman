pacman
======

Simple 2D pacman in Java to test several AI things (search/planning/q-learning/machine learning).

Current state (21.12.2012) looks like this:

![Pacman 1][pcm1]

Basic human pacman movement works quite good. The red ghost is chasing the pacman's movement (THE STALKER!), the other guy is just running arround randomly.
