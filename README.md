pacman
======

Simple 2D pacman in Java to test several AI things (search/planning/q-learning/machine learning). 
Note that my maze generation is a bit exotic, so it doesn't look like a real pacman ;-)

Build
-----

It requires all my three core libraries:

[tjungblut-math](https://github.com/thomasjungblut/tjungblut-math "Thomas' nifty math lib")

[tjungblut-common](https://github.com/thomasjungblut/thomasjungblut-common "Thomas' nifty common lib")

[tjungblut-graph](https://github.com/thomasjungblut/tjungblut-graph "Thomas' nifty graph lib")

and Java7 to compile.
